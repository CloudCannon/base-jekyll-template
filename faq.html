  - question: What has changed in Corporate Clash?
    answer: New features, new graphics, and new places to explore! There's a ton of new and exciting changes and features added to Toontown: Corporate Clash!
  - question: I played Project Altis. Can I play on my old toons?
    answer: We took a step back when deciding whether or not we toons would be carried over from Project Altis to Corporate Clash. After consideration and a community poll, we (and the community) decided that accounts and toons would need to be remade. See more details at [Let's Talk Resets](https://corporateclash.net/news/article/7) and [The Winner is](https://corporateclash.net/news/article/10).
  - question: Do I have to purchase a subscription or pay to play?
    answer: Although we're legally a non-profit and tax exempt, we do not make money or have an income stream from our playerbase, ads, or otherwise. The game is and will always be completely free to play.
  - question: What is a collection?
    answer: Not everything is a post or a page. Maybe you want to document the various methods in your open source project, members of a team, or talks at a conference. Collections allow you to define a new type of document that behave like Pages or Posts do normally, but also have their own unique properties and namespace.
  - question: Can I donate for server costs?
    answer: We love how much you like to play Corporate Clash, however, we do not accept donations. If you want to support us, simply share our website link or recommend us to your friends.
