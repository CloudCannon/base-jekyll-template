If you've read the [FAQ](https://www.wanikani.com/faq) or the [WaniKani Guide](www.wanikani.com/guide) (hint, hint), then you've seen us going on about something called the **SRS.** But what the heck is an SRS?

Stay awhile and listen, young durtle, and all will be revealed.

**SRS** stands for **S**paced **R**epetition **S**ystem (not to be confused Spontaneous Ramen Spectroscopy, which is when you use the noodles that randomly turn up in your fridge as a microscope). Spaced repetition is a learning technique that adjusts your time between reviews based on how well you did. If you get something, the interval between now and the next review will get longer. If you get it wrong, the interval gets shorter. It's based on the [spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect), which says that you learn better when it's spread out over a greater period of time instead of jammed into a small one.

WaniKani combines this technique with [interleaving](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/interleaving-japanese/) and [mnemonics](https://www.tofugu.com/series/japanese-mnemonics/) to teach you kanji in the most effective way possible. If you want to know more, check out Koichi's [guide to spaced repetition](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/spaced-repetition/) over on [Tofugu](www.tofugu.com).
