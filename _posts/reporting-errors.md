Found an error? Spotted a typo? Got other kinds of feedback you want give us? The best way to let us know is by email. You can either use the contact form (just click the Contact button down at the bottom of WaniKani), or you can send an email to hello@wanikani.com.

We have sections for general feedback over on the forums, too, but we'll notice emails a lot quicker, which is why it's the preferred method. This goes double for bugs, which we want to fix as quickly as possible!
