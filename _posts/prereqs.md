Not for the beginning.

WaniKani starts you off with [radicals](x), which don't require any other knowledge on your part. It's a good idea to start learning hiragana now, though, if you don't know it already. You'll need hiragana when you start learning kanji in a few more days.

Fortunately, learning hiragana is easier than you might think. We have a [guide to learning hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/) that will get you ready to go in no time.

Katakana won't show up for a couple levels, but you'll want to get that under your belt as well. Don't worry, we've got you covered there too with our very own [guide for katakana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/).

Finally, once you've learned hiragana and katakana, you should probably know how to type them. As always, the [Crabigator's got your back](x).
