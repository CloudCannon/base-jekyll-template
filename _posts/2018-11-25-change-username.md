If you'd like to change your username, you can do so from your [Account Settings](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/account).

Some things you should know about usernames:

* They're case sensitive (iFyOuWanTtHisYouCAn)
* Must be at least 3 characters
* No dashes (-) or underscores (_)

If your username is taken, we can't take it from someone else to give it to you, so don't bother asking. First come, first served is the way of the internet.

And don't make it a bad word either, cause we'll find you and change it to something embarrassing, like the name you called your stuffed bunny as a kid. Or the word you get wrong the most in your reviews.
