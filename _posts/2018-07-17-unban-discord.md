After being kicked from the discord multiple times, you may see something like this:

This means that you may be banned from our Discord server for misconduct. 

### How could this happen?

This could have happened for many reasons:

  - You may have broken one of our discord rules
  - You may have sent a direct message to all, or a good amount of our server members
  - You may have been falsely banned

### How can I be unbanned?

Discord bans are usually our final action against a server member, however you may appeal a ban by sending an email to [support@corporateclash.net](mailto:support@corporateclash.net) with the following information:

  - Why you think you were banned
  - Any information on your actions leading up to being banned
  - Your discord tag, as well as screenshots of past messages from our moderation bot
  - Why you want to be unbanned from the discord

We cannot guarantee that appealing your ban will get you unbanned, however anwering all of the above questions clearly will greatly improve your chances and improve our response time.
