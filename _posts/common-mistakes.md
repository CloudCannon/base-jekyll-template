Is WaniKani telling you that your answer is wrong and you can't figure out why? Odds are it's one of the following reasons:

### Readings vs Meanings
Kanji (and vocabulary) have two parts to them: a meaning and a reading. Be sure to pay attention to what the review is asking for. One big giveaway is that “reading” answers will automatically be changed to kana and “meaning” answers will stay in English. Read more about this [here](x).

### Multiple Readings
Lots of kanji have multiple readings, like 大 (たい, だい) or 力 (りき, りょく). You’ll want to put in just one of the answers, not both. Some items have a lot of possible answers, and we don’t want people to spend thirty seconds typing them all out.

### Small Characters
Most likely, you are putting in a big や, ゆ, or よ instead of a small one. Sometimes it's tough to spot the difference at first, but you'll see it when they're side-by-side:

にゆう = niyuu
にゅう = nyuu
じよう = jiyou
じょう = jou/jyou
きゆう = kiyuu
きゅう = kyuu
りよく = riyoku
りょく = ryoku
じゆう = jiyuu
じゅう = juu/jyuu
じよ = jiyo
じょ = jo/jyo

The difference is big, and it’s important to get these correct. For example, じゆう means “freedom,” so if you wrote that in instead of じゅう you would be saying something completely different.

Typing in Japanese can take some getting used to. If you need a little help, we have a big guide on [how to type anything and everything in Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-type-in-japanese/).
