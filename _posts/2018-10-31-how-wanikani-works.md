Thanks for giving WaniKani a try. And, thanks for actually reading the guide.

What makes WaniKani different?

## Mnemonics

Every radical, kanji, and vocabulary word you learn on WaniKani comes paired hand-crafted mnemonic written by one of our loving staff. These are little stories to help you to remember the meaning and/or reading of each item. While many people are skeptical at first, stories are one of the few things we humans are good at memorizing (now where did I put my keys?). Give it a try and you may be surprised.

You'll use a mnemonic to learn the radical. Then, you'll use the radicals to make a story to learn a kanji's meaning and reading. Finally, you'll use your newfound kanji knowledge to learn a vocabulary word. Not a moment of memorization in sight.

To learn more about mnemonics and their effectiveness, check out our ["Mnemonics & You!"](#) page.

## Spaced Repetition System

After learning memorizing radical, kanji, and vocabulary meanings/readings, you need to practice recalling that information! To do that, WaniKani utilizes a flashcard system that seems simple at first, but is actually doing a lot of "science stuff" behind the scenes. The biggest thing is the frequency at which individual items appear in your Reviews.

Take, for example, Item A. You keep getting this one wrong. The WaniKani system knows this, so it will quiz you on it more often. On the other hand, you're really good at Item B. You've gotten in correct many times in a row. Each time you get it correct, the WaniKani system increases the time between quizzes. When you recall a piece of information just before you're about to forget it, your brain actually tags it as more important, making it easier to recall next time. This series of longer and longer spaces between correct recalls is how we get a radical, kanji, and vocabulary to automatic in your brain (in other words, fluent recall).

That being said, all you have to do is sit down and do your reviews. We'll take care of all the science stuff.

Some more text from another page:

You learn kanji and vocabulary meanings and readings with mnemonics. This means you are able to memorize more items in one sitting, plus the ability to recall them degrades more slowly over time.

WaniKani teaches you efficiently by using a Spaced Repetition System to manage your reviews.

WaniKani makes you learn things the “hard” way, which means no furigana, no multiple choice, or anything else that gives your brain a shortcut.

The ordering of items in WaniKani was created specifically for adults who speak English, not for kids that already speak Japanese. Here’s the difference: Japanese schoolchildren learn kanji in an order based on how simple the meaning of a kanji is. So a kanji that has fifteen strokes but has a simple meaning will come before a kanji that has two strokes but has a difficult meaning. As an English speaking adult (or close to it), you already understand the meanings of difficult words and concepts, but the difference between a kanji with twenty strokes and two strokes is huge for you! WaniKani teaches you simple kanji (in terms of structure) first and builds off that knowledge to grow your ability to learn more complicated kanji. In the long term, you are able to learn all the kanji you need to be literate much more quickly and with less friction.

WaniKani only teaches the most important things, and ignores the rest. Most kanji have a meaning or reading that’s used 90% of the time, and a bunch of other readings that make up the remaining 10%. While that 10% is still important, we don’t want you spending a bunch of time and effort on these that you could be using to learn new kanji. That means we also skip things like handwriting and stroke order. By keeping you focused on the most useful stuff, we get you reading real Japanese sooner, where you’ll learn all those exceptions anyway.

Now that you have a general understanding of WaniKani and how it works [it's time to do your first lesson](/1.%20getting%20started/first-lessons/).
