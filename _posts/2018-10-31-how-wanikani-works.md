Thanks for giving WaniKani a try. And, thanks for actually reading the guide.

What makes WaniKani different?

## Mnemonics

Every radical, kanji, and vocabulary word you learn on WaniKani comes paired hand-crafted mnemonic written by one of our loving staff. These are little stories to help you to remember the meaning and/or reading of each item. While many people are skeptical at first, stories are one of the few things we humans are good at memorizing (now where did I put my keys?). Give it a try and you may be surprised.

You'll use a mnemonic to learn the radical. Then, you'll use the radicals to make a story to learn a kanji's meaning and reading. Finally, you'll use your newfound kanji knowledge to learn a vocabulary word. Not a moment of memorization in sight.

## Spaced Repetition System

After learning memorizing radical, kanji, and vocabulary meanings/readings, you need to practice recalling that information! To do that, WaniKani utilizes a flashcard system that seems simple at first, but is actually doing a lot of "science stuff" behind the scenes. The biggest thing is the frequency at which individual items appear in your Reviews.

Take, for example, Item A. You keep getting this one wrong. The WaniKani system knows this, so it will quiz you on it more often. On the other hand, you're really good at Item B. You've gotten in correct many times in a row. Each time you get it correct, the WaniKani system increases the time between quizzes. When you recall a piece of information just before you're about to forget it, your brain actually tags it as more important, making it easier to recall next time. This series of longer and longer spaces between correct recalls is how we get a radical, kanji, and vocabulary to automatic in your brain (in other words, fluent recall).

That being said, all you have to do is sit down and do your reviews. We'll take care of all the science stuff.
