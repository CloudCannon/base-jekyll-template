Oh Crabigator, I have a huge number of reviews to do and it's too much! Can you work your crab/gator magic and just make them all go away?

Nope, I'm afraid not. While you can [reset your account](x), there's no way to clear out _just_ your reviews. You'll need to decide between trying to work through what you have, or going back to an earlier level.

Be sure to read [what we have to say](x) about a reset before you decide to turn back the clock, because things may not be as bad as you think.
