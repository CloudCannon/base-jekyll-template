Forget to cancel your subscription? Suffering from buyer's remorse? Need money to buy those rare Pok√©mon cards that suddenly went on eBay? No worries!

You have 60 days after the payment to ask for a refund for any reason whatsoever (we won't ask or judge). That goes for the monthly, annual, and lifetime plans.

Just make sure to [let us know ASAP by emailing us](/wanikani/contact-page/) **from the email address your WaniKani account is under**. We have to make sure it's you, after all, and not your vengeful younger siblings who think you're spending all your time studying kanji instead of hanging out with them.
