With Extra Study you can practice your recent lessons and recent review mistakes with the same quiz interface. Unlike reviews, in Extra Study your mistakes don’t count. You can practice them as much (or as little) as you want. Extra Study is completely optional!

**Recent Lessons**

Use Extra Study’s Recent Lessons mode if you’ve just finished doing a set of lessons and want to quiz yourself to make sure you’ve learned them. You can also use it if you’ve been having trouble with new lessons in reviews. Studying Recent Lessons during your free time will help improve your memory and give you a better chance of success in your upcoming reviews.

**What’s considered a Recent Lesson?**

Any item you’ve learned in lessons and haven’t Guru’d in your reviews will be part of Recent Lessons mode. Once you complete your reviews and the item moves to the Guru stage, this will no longer remain in Recent Lessons.

A recent lesson can be a recent mistake too.

**Recent Mistakes**

Use Extra Study’s Recent Mistakes mode to practice mistakes in reviews. You don’t have to wait for that item you got wrong to be available again in reviews.

**What’s considered a Recent Mistake?**

Any item you’ve made a mistake on within the last 24 hours of doing reviews will be part of this mode. Even if you got an item right in the last hour, but you got it wrong 10 hours ago, it’ll be part of Recent Mistakes.

Both Recent Lessons and Recent Mistakes are there to help you be successful in your Reviews. Use them as much as you’d like, but only if you have the time for it. It’s called *Extra* Study for a reason, so don’t worry if you can’t get to them either.
