Furigana is actually really bad for your kanji learning. Your eyes will automatically go to it when you read in Japanese, and since we teach kanji ‘round these parts, we don’t want to make things harder for you. Furigana has this curious effect of making you _feel_ like you’re learning, without you actually learning anything. It’s dangerous!

If you really, really don’t want to have to go to another tab and copy/paste words into an online dictionary, you could always download an extension like [rikaichan](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichan/) or [rikaikun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en), depending on your browser. Please don't email us asking us to add it to WaniKani, though, because we aren't going to. Never ever.
