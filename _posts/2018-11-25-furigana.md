WaniKani doesn't provide [furigana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana) for anything.

Why?

Because furigana will actively hinder your kanji learning.

When we read Japanese with furigana, our eyes automatically go to it first. The same thing happens when you watch something with subtitles. Whether you want to or not, you're going to look.

Since we teach kanji 'round here, we don't take kindly to anything that might hold you back, slow you down, or make it _feel_ like you're learning when you aren't.

If you want to check the readings of words you don't know in, say, the context sentences, there are some great extensions like [rikaichan](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichan/) for Mozilla Firefox or [rikaikun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en) for Google Chrome.

Just promise you won't abuse them.
