We don't, and there's a couple reasons for it. One, WaniKani teaches kanji using radicals, so we donâ€™t want you focusing too much on strokes. Two, odds are you won't be handwriting kanji very much in the digital age, so knowing the stroke order isn't as useful.

If you want to learn stroke order for learning writing by hand, we recommend that you [learn the rules of stroke order](http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/kanji-stroke-order/) instead, which gives you a much better bang for your buck then memorizing all those individual storkes like most people are forced to.
