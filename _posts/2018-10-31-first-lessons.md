This will get you to your available lessons. Every Lesson on WaniKani builds off of past proven knowledge[...]

## Learning the Lessons

You'll start off by learning [radicals](#), which as you know are [the building blocks for learning kanji](/1.%20getting%20started/how-wanikani-works/#radicals-as-building-blocks). Lessons for radicals consist of two parts, which are:

1. The English Meaning
2. Examples

**The English meaning** is what we are going to call the radical. Your job is to [use the mnemonic](/1.%20getting%20started/how-wanikani-works/#mnemonics) to learn that English meaning.

The second tab, **Examples**, is there to show you kanji that will use the radical as a building block. See if you can see where the radical is being used in the example kanji.

When you've cycled through the two lesson tabs, you'll be given a new radical to learn. After memorizing a handful of lessons (approximately seven), you'll be taken to the quiz section of the lessons.

## The Lesson Quiz

Here's where we see how much you remembered. You'll be quizzed on the radicals you just learned.

Afterward, it will indicate whether or not you got the answer right. Complete the quiz to send these items to your [Review queue](#). To move on as quickly as possible, you'll want to finish all of your available lessons. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it's a good idea to hold off on lessons until you're feeling like you can handle things.

## Finishing Your First Set of Lessons

When you've completed all the lessons available to you as a new user, it's time for you to [complete your most difficult task yet: waiting](/1.%20getting%20started/waiting-for-reviews/).
