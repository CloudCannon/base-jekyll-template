Does your reading answer for 入, 女, 九, 力, 上, or 十 keep getting marked wrong and you don't know why? Before you smash your computer and swear vengeance on WaniKani, let's talk about small characters.

Small characters are exactly what they sound like - smaller versions of certain hiragana characters. Here are some examples:

や　ゃ (ya)
ゆ　ゅ (yu)
よ　ょ (yo)

If you don't know what we're talking about, we recommend you [learn how to read hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/)! It's a prerequisite to using WaniKani, and you can do it over the next couple days.

The small and regular-sized versions of those characters can totally change the meaning of a word. Take for example 十 (じゅう), a level one kanji. If you write じゅう (jyuu), it means ten (just like it's supposed to). However, if you write じゆう (jiyuu) the meaning is "freedom."

So how do you type the small characters? It's pretty easy, once you're looking for them. Check out our guide on [how to type in Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-type-in-japanese/). It will cover all your small-kana typing needs, not to mention go over other strange things, like how to type ん, and how to type the double small tsu.

For a quick crash course, though, here are some examples of small character combo hiragana and how to type them. You will see these the early levels of WaniKani:

にゅう = nyuu  NOT にゆう = niyuu
じょう = jou/jyou  NOT じよう = jiyou
じゅう = juu/jyuu  NOT じゆう = jiyuu
じょ = jo/jyo NOT じよ = jiyo
きゅう = kyuu  NOT きゆう = kiyuu
りょく = ryoku NOT りよく = riyoku
