WaniKani is a paid service after level 3.

If you decide to [purchase a WaniKani subscription](/account-and-membership/payment-and-billing/subscription-plans/), you get access to a lot of (cool) stuff!

Premium WaniKani content currently includes levels 4-60. You also get access to [Vacation Mode](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/account), which lets you pause your reviews if you're going to be away for more than a day or two.

What subscribing _doesn't_ do is make WaniKani go any faster; you'll still need to do your reviews and level up like everyone else.
