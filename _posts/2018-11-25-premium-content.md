You've taken the plunge and signed up for a WaniKani subscription - nice! So what exactly do you _get_ with your shiny new subscription?

Well, the main thing is that you get to keep progressing in WaniKani. Levels 4-60 are considered "premium" content, so they're only available if you have an active subscription. You also get access to [Vacation Mode](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/account), which lets you pause your reviews if you're going to be away.

What subscribing _doesn't_ do is make WaniKani go any faster; you'll still need to do your reviews and level up like normal.
