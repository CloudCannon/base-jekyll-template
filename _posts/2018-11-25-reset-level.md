So you started WaniKani and, for a while, things were going great. Then something happened; you got busy with school, you started pulling overtime for your job, you adopted twelve rescue pets, and your computer became sentient and tried to take over the world. It's OK, we've all been there.

Whatever it was, you didn't have time for WaniKani like you used to. Now, months later, you're ready to get back on the horse and start learning kanji again. You log back in, only to find an angry horde of reviews ready to burn down your farm and steal your livestock. Even worse, you've forgotten some of the kanji and the mnemonics that went along with them. What are you supposed to do?

Don't worry. For starters, things probably aren't quite as bad as they look at first glance. Let's say you have 800 reviews waiting for you in the queue. That's a lot! But that isn't going to be 800 reviews _every day._ A lot of those items are heading towards higher [SRS levels](#). They won't be showing up every day. If you can fight your way through the first giant review pile, the next day will have a bit less. So on and so forth. You may have to put aside a month to clear your reviews down to a more manageable number, but that can be better than resetting your account. The struggle will also tell your brain to create stronger neural pathways to that information. It's painful, but it's a win-win.

If you still want to reset, you have the option to take your WaniKani account back to an earlier level. When you reset your account, it takes you back to the _start_ of the level you reset to. That means you lose all the data at and above the level you chose to reset to. Resetting back to level 1 will wipe _everything,_ meaning that you're effectively starting over fresh. The reset doesn't just remove reviews and unlocks, though, it also clears out any custom synonyms or notes had for those levels, so make sure you're okay with losing all that before you take the plunge. We can't bring the data back, not matter how nicely you ask.

You can reset your account over in the [Danger Zone](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/danger_zone), which is a dangerous place inside your account settings. Proceed with caution.
