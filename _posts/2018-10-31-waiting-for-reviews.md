You've [finished your first lessons](/1.%20getting%20started/first-lessons/). Now what?

Turns out, you have to wait a bit. As you know, review timings use a [spaced repetition system](/1.%20getting%20started/how-wanikani-works/#spaced-repetition-system). We're trying to give you a review right before you're about to forget something. This is the most efficient timing for memorizing information. Your brain places more importance on it as something to remember, and you are able to review the item fewer times with the same or better results.

When you have more items in your review pile, you'll have a lot to do. But, since learning every kanji and vocabulary word relies on proven, past knowledge, you can't just do reviews whenever you want. Especially in the beginning it will feel like you're doing a lot of waiting. But actually you're solidifying the building blocks that you'll be using to learn kanji. Learning this much kanji is a long-term effort, so what's a couple weeks of "slowness" in exchange for a much faster overall speed?

To minimize the amount of waiting you do in the early levels, we recommend you do all your available lessons and then do your reviews when they're available. Your first set of radicals will start [unlocking kanji](#) in a few days if you keep it up.

Check your dashboard to see how long until your next set of reviews become available. In the meantime, you can read about [doing your first reviews](/1.%20getting%20started/first-reviews/).
