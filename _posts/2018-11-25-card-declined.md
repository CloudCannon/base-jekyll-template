Having a problem buying a subscription? If the transaction isn't going through, there are a couple likely culprits.

If youâ€™re using a card that was issued outside of the United States you may need to call your bank to allow for international charges. There can be extra bank fees associated with these types of transactions, so keep an eye out for that too. Another possibility is that your card is set up to block recurring charges, which the WaniKani subscription is.

Whatever the case, it's very likely that your bank/card provider is blocking it for some reason or other. We don't get much more information than you do about why a card gets declined, so you're probably better off contacting them before you email us.
