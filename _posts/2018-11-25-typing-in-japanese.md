You've Guru'ed those first radicals and finally gotten some real kanji. That's great! But now WaniKani wants you to type stuff _in_ Japanese. So how do you turn what you type in your non-Japanese keyboard into kana? Don't worry, it's actually pretty easy.

For starters, WaniKani has a built in [IME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method) that will handle all the conversions for you. There's no need to install an IME or buy a Japanese keyboard for your computer or device. Whenever it asks for [a reading-type answer](#), anything you type will be converted into kana.

(If you _want_ to install one for other purposes, check out our [walkthrough](http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-install-japanese-keyboard/) over on Tofugu, though you shouldn't use it when doing your Lessons or Reviews on WaniKani.)

Still, this doesn't mean anything if you don't know how to type in Japanese. Check out our [guide to typing in Japanese](http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-type-in-japanese/) any time you're not sure how to get a particular character. WaniKani also has a dropdown menu of all the hiragana/katakana characters that you can select from. It's no replacement for learning how to type, but it's great for when you know the answer but just can't remember how to type that one weird dakuten combo kana.
