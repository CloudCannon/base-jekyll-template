If there is a radical, kanji, or vocabulary word missing an English meaning you know, you can add it to your personal user synonyms.

If your first language isn't English, you can use this feature to add translations as well.

WaniKani isn't a dictionary, so it's very possible that we don't teach every English meaning for every word. We choose to focus on the most important meanings and readings instead. By taking away less important information, we are making it easier to learn more important information.

If you feel there is an absolutely essential meaning missing from an item, email us at [hello@wanikani.com](mailto:hello@wanikani.com).
