Monthly and Annual subscriptions to WaniKani are... subscriptions! That means they automatically renew when they run out (each month, or year, depending on the plan you chose).

If you don't want your subscription to renew, you'll need to stop it manually.

Head over to the [Billing page](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription/billing) and hit cancel.

Once you choose to cancel, your account will no longer resubscribe when it runs out. We'll send you an email before it cancels though, so you'll have time to change your mind.

You can also remove your card from the [Billing page](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription/billing) by updating your card information.

Make sure to cancel your subscription as well, though!
