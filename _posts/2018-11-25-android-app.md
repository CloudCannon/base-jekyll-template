Are you using the official WaniKani app?

Probably not, because currently we don't have an official app on the App Store or Google Play Store. Most likely, you're using a third-party app, so please send _them_ a message telling them their app isn't working.

There are a few third-party mobile apps out there that work pretty well, though. You'll need to add your API key, [which can be found in your Account Page](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/account). For suggestions on third-party apps to run WaniKani on your phone, head on over to the community forums. There's an [API and third party apps section](https://community.wanikani.com/c/wanikani/api-and-third-party-apps) filled with helpful posts and people.
