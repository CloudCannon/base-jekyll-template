## Question

Can I use Travis CI with Spinnaker?

## Answer

Yes! Just like Jenkins, Spinnaker has a native integration with Travis. You can easily use it to trigger deployments once CI builds finish. However, unlike with Jenkins, you _cannot_ use Travis to run arbitrary jobs. This is more of a limitation imposed by Travis than a limitation of Spinnaker itself.


## Configuring a Travis Master

[Igor](https://github.com/spinnaker/igor) is the Spinnaker service responsible for interacting with external CI systems like Jenkins and Travis. So, in order to configure a Travis Master, you'll need to add the following configuration to `igor-local.yml`.

```yaml
services:
  travis:
    enabled: true
    defaultMaster:
      name: ci
      baseUrl: https://travis-ci.org
      address: https://api.travis-ci.org
      githubToken: a-github-token
```

The above configuration will register the default Travis instance with the name `ci`. If your organization uses multiple Travis CI instances, you can register them using the following configuration:

```yaml
travis:
  enabled: true
  # Travis names are prefixed with travis- inside igor.
  masters:
  - name: ci # This will show as travis-ci inside spinnaker.
    baseUrl: https://travis-ci.org
    address: https://api.travis-ci.org
    githubToken: a-github-token
  - name: ci-2
    baseUrl: https://travis-ci.org
    address: https://api.travis-ci.org
    githubToken: another-github-token
  regexes:
  - /Upload https?:\/\/.+\/(.+\.(deb|rpm))/
```

The  `regexes` key is used to pull build information out of the Travis build log using the `art` CLI. This information is then used by Spinnaker pipelines to inform Bake stages which package versions should be installed.
