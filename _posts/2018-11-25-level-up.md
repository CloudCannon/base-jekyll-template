In order to level up you need to reach [Guru](#) status on 90% of the kanji in your current level.

And you do this by [completing your reviews](#)! Once you hit that 90% you'll automatically level up!

This will add all the (appropriate) Lessons to your queue and your progress bars will go back to 0.

You can see how many kanji you have left from the number on your progress bar, and you can view the kanji you haven't guru'd yet by clicking See Apprentice Kanji Left.

Radicals and Vocabulary have no affect on your level. However, radicals are needed to unlock kanji, so if you don't have all of your radicals at guru, you won't get their kanji, and that may slow down your ability to level up.
