You've gotten through the first batch of radicals and unlocked your first kanji. Congratulations! Kanji and vocabulary work a bit differently than radicals, however. For starters, they have two parts to them: Readings and Meanings.

The _Reading_ of a kanji (or a vocab term) is the Japanese pronunciation(s) of the character. The _Meaning,_ on the other hand, is exactly what it sounds like: the English definition of the kanji. Not surprisingly, Readings are going to be in hiragana, and Meanings are going to be in English.

There are a couple ways to tell which answer you should enter during reviews. If you look under the picture of the kanji and above the answer field, it will tell you if it wants the Reading or Meaning. If it's a Reading it will be a dark bar with light text, while Meanings have a light background with dark text.


WaniKani will also automatically convert your input into kana when it's asking for a Reading, so you also check to see if your answer is showing up in English or Japanese. Of course, you'll still need to know _what_ to type, so make sure you're brushed up on how to [type in Japanese]().
