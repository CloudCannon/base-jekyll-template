"I just noticed that some of your radical names are wrong! WaniKani is literally the worst thing ever. Literally!"

Wow, _literally?_ Those are some strong words. But before you fire off that blistering email telling us everything we've gotten wrong, let's talk quickly about what radicals _are._

Radicals are primarily a tool to classify and index kanji. You can also use them to help figure out what a kanji meansâ€”WaniKani does this by incorporating the radicals into mnemonics - but mostly radicals are there so you have a way to look kanji up in the dictionary.

The most commonly used set of radicals is probably the 214 Kangxi radicals, which get their name from an [18th Century Chinese dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Dictionary). It's not the only list out there, however.

When putting WaniKani together, we found that the Kangxi names - which, remember, exist to help you _look up_ kanji - weren't always the best choice for learning what kanji actually _mean._ When that happened, we changed the names to create better mnemonics, to the great frustration of nitpickers everywhere.

"I'm no nitpicker!" you exclaim, jumping to your feet and shaking a fist towards the heavens. A nitpick is arguing over a minor detail, but radical names are the hill you're prepared to die on.

Wow, we didn't expect so much passion over this. You have quite the _radical_ position.

The point is, some of the radical names are different. We recommend trying to learn our names, since that's what the mnemonics are going to be using. If it's really, truly throwing you off, however, than you can always add the name you want as a [User Synonym](x).
