If you've read the [FAQ](https://www.wanikani.com/faq) or the [WaniKani Guide](www.wanikani.com/guide) (hint, hint), then you've seen us going on about something called the **SRS.** But what the heck is an SRS?

Stay awhile and listen, young durtle, and all will be revealed.

**SRS** stands for **S**paced **R**epetition **S**ystem, which is based on the [spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect).

The spacing effect basically says that you learn better when things are spread out over a greater period of time instead of jammed into a few hours or days.

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that adjusts your time between reviews for individual items so that your recall is tested at the most idea time for your memory. The goal is show you a review _just_ before you would forget it. The better you know an item, the longer it will be until it comes up again for review. If you keep getting something wrong, the time between reviews will go down, meaning you'll see it more often.

Not only is this kind of flexible spacing more efficient (you can memorize an item with fewer total reviews), but it better matches the way your actual memory works as well.

WaniKani combines this technique with [interleaving](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/interleaving-japanese/) and [mnemonics](https://www.tofugu.com/series/japanese-mnemonics/) to teach you kanji in the most effective way possible. If you want to know more, check out Koichi's [guide to spaced repetition](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/spaced-repetition/) over on [Tofugu](www.tofugu.com).
