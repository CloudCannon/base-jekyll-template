[After you've finished waiting for your reviews](/1.%20getting%20started/waiting-for-reviews/), it's time to do them. Start by clicking "Reviews" in the top menu.

From there, you'll see a quiz screen that's very similar to the Lessons quiz you did earlier. You'll see a question asking for a radical name.

Simply write in the answer.

Hit enter or submit to see if you got it right or wrong. Keep doing this until you've cleared all of your reviews. When you have, it's time to wait and stretch the amount of time you can remember this information. When they're available again, you should do them again.

For more detailed information about reviews, including reviewing kanji and vocabulary, check out our [Reviews tutorial](#).

## Keep Going

Assuming you completed all your Lessons, all that's left is for you to keep doing reviews. If you get the answers right, you'll see kanji unlock sooner. If you don't, it will be a little longer. More information can be found on our [Leveling Up](#) page, but rest assured if you keep doing your reviews on time [you'll unlock kanji in 2-3 days]().
