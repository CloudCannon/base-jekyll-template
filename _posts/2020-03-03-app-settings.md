## Lessons and Reviews

*Batch sizing:* The default number is 5 lessons (individual items) before a quiz. If you want to learn more or less radicals, kanji, or vocabulary before the quiz, you can adjust this anywhere from 3 to 10 lessons.

*Lesson ordering:* The default for this is set to ‘Ascending level then subject’. This means that if you have leveled up to Level 2, but you have just unlocked level 1 vocabulary, in your lessons pile, Level 1 items will show up before you move on to Level 2 Radicals. The order of the subjects is radicals, kanji, then vocabulary. The reason for this is so that you can focus on learning the previous level material first, even if you’ve already advanced to the next level.

Another setting you can choose is ‘shuffled’, meaning all new lessons regardless of level or subject will be shuffled.

You can also choose ‘ascending level then shuffled’ which means previous level lessons will be shown first, but the subjects (radicals, kanji, vocabulary) will be shuffled.
