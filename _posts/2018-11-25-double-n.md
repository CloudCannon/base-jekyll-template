WaniKani uses the standard style of Japanese IME (input method editor).

Typing one n does not result in ん because you also need to be able to type na, ni, nu, ne, and no (なにぬねの). If it converted immediately, there would be no way to type any of those characters!

Understanding how the Japanese n works is very important for spelling words correctly when typing in Japanese too. For example:

ona = おな \\
onna = おんあ \\
onnna = おんな

Speed demon tip: You don't _have_ to type the double n to make ん _at the end of a word_ when answering the [reading](#) of a kanji or vocabulary word. We'll auto-convert the final n to ん for you. BUT it's much better if you get used to typing it correctly right from the start. Your Japanese teacher or boss won't be as lenient as us.

And don't worry, you’ll get used to typing the double n in nno time!
