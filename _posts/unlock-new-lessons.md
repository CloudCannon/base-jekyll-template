### How do I get more lessons?

The quick answer is: Do your reviews!

New content is unlocked by getting radicals and kanji to Guru status. WaniKani has a progression of radicals -> kanji -> vocabulary, so when you Guru radicals it will open up new kanji for you to learn, and kanji will introduce vocab.

Not sure what 'Guru' means or how to get there? It's all part of the [SRS tiers](link to SRS entry will go here).
