Uh oh, you're here. I guess that means we messed up somewhere.

If you spot a typo, weird formatting, or an error of any kind, let us know! The best way to do that is [by email](/account-and-membership/wanikani/contact-page/) or the [contact form](https://www.wanikani.com/contact).

There's a handy shortcut to this form at the bottom right-hand corner of all Lessons and Reviews.

And don't worry if you're in the middle of a long set of Reviews, this button opens the form in a new tab, so you won't lose your place.

Make sure to include the item type (Radical, Kanji, or Vocab), the item itself, and a short explanation of what's wrong. Bonus points for screenshots. Bonus, bonus points if the issue is highlighted in the screenshot.

<small>PS. All points are made up and the points don't matter. \\
