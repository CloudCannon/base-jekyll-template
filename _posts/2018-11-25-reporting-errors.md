Uh oh, you're here. I guess that means we messed up somewhere.

If you spot a typo, weird formatting, or an error of any kind, let us know! The best way to do that is by email: [hello@wanikani.com](mailto:hello@wanikani.com).

Or, you can use the [contact form](https://www.wanikani.com/contact). There's a handy shortcut to this form at the bottom left-hand corner of all Lessons and Reviews.

`giphy of usage`

And don't worry if you're in the middle of a long set of Reviews, this button opens the form in a new tab, so you won't lose your place.

Make sure to include the item type (Radical, Kanji, or Vocab), the item itself, and a short explanation of what's wrong. Bonus points for screenshots. Bonus, bonus points if the issue is highlighted in the screenshot.

PS. All points are made up and the points don't matter.

PPS. Is that copyrighted? I don't want to get sued.

PPPS. I don't think so, but I guess we'll find out.
