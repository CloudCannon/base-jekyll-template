Found an error? Spotted a typo? Got other kinds of feedback you want give us? The best way to let us know is by email. You can either use the contact form (just click the Contact button down at the bottom of WaniKani), or you can send an email to [hello@wanikani.com](mailto:hello@wanikani.com).

If you have general feedback, or want to bounce around ideas, we have a [feedback section in the community forums](https://community.wanikani.com/c/wanikani/feedback). If you found a bug or typo, though, definitely email us instead so we can get it fixed as soon as possible!
