### Small vs big characters

Does your reading answer for 入 or 十 keep getting marked wrong and you don't know why? Before you smash your computer and swear vengeance on WaniKani, let's talk about small characters.

Small characters are exactly what they sound like - smaller versions of certain hiragana characters. Here are some examples:
ゆ　ゅ
よ　ょ
や　ゃ
They show up in combo hiragana and they make a big difference, so it's important to be looking for them. The reading for 十 is じゅう which means "ten" but じゆう, with all big characters is means "freedom," which completely changes what you're saying.

Ok, so how do you type them? It's pretty easy, once you're looking for them.We have a big guide about [how to type in Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-type-in-japanese/) that should cover just about all of your typing needs for WaniKani - you should definitely check that out - but we'll show you some examples of combo hiragana you're going to run into early on.


にゅう = nyuu  NOT にゆう = niyuu
じょう = jou/jyou  NOT じよう = jiyou
じゅう = juu/jyuu  NOT じゆう = jiyuu
じょ = jo/jyo NOT じよ = jiyo
きゅう = kyuu  NOT きゆう = kiyuu
りょく = ryoku NOT りよく = riyoku
