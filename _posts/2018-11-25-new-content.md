WaniKani covers a lot of radicals, kanji, and vocabulary.

Not all of them though.

If there is an item you think we absolutely MUST have, let us know! Now, that doesn't mean we'll add it the same day, it takes time to add new items. But we'll definitely think about it for our next update!

## How to Request New Content

If you have an item (or items) you'd like us to add to WaniKani send an email to hello@wanikani.com or fill out our [contact form](https://www.wanikani.com/contact) and look something like the following:

Just make sure you check to make sure whatever you're requesting isn't on the site already!
