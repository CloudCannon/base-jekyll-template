If your credit card expires or you want to put a different card on file, head over to our [billing page](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription/billing) to change your information. From there, you can update your card information.

Note that we do not accept all credit cards and prepaid cards do not always work.

## Are you having issues with your current card not working?

Sometimes you need to update your expiration date. I know that seems obvious, but itâ€™s easy to miss, so make sure you check!
