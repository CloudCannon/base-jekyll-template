Toonstep is our email verification system that prevents unauthorized logins to your account if you're logging in from a new [IP address](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address). 


### Who is this for?

Toonstep is only necessary for certain people, such as if:

  - You use a since password or only a few passwords across multiple websites
  - You would like extra security for the sake of it
  - You have a static IP address 

If you use a strong, randomly generated password, or have a dynamic IP address and are certain you have a secure password, you may not need ToonStep. 


### How do I revoke an IP from access to my account?

If you'd like to revoke a previously allowed IP address from access to your account, you can do the following:

1. Go to https://corporateclash.net/account
    - Log in if not already logged in
2. On the account page, select the "ToonStep" tab
3. On the list of allowed IP addresses on the ToonStep tab, find the specific IP address or location you'd like to revoke.
4. In the "action" column, click the "revoke" button corresponding to that IP address.
