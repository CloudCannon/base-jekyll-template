### I already know this stuff - can I just skip it?

Nope, I'm afraid not. There's no way to speed up WaniKani or to skip early levels, not even if you email us and promise to be our best friend.

That means that, right now, everyone needs to start from the beginning and level up normally. Even if you already have some kanji under your belt, try sticking it out through level 3 and see how it goes. There might be some kanji you don't know mixed in with familiar ones, and you'll be learning vocab along the way as well. Not to mention those levels are free, so why not?

Not sure how to level up? Read all about it [here](link to leveling up).
