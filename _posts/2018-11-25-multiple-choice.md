WaniKani does not and will not allow for multiple choice answers.

The thing about multiple choice is that you don’t actually have to **recall** anything. You just narrow down the answer and choose the most appropriate one. Or, your brain will pick whatever answer feels the most “familiar.” With multiple choice, that answer is usually pretty obvious.

When you have to recall an answer and actually, physically type it in, you’re forced to pull that item out of your brain, much like you would in real life. When you’re reading a Japanese book, you don’t have four options in front of you to choose from, you have to remember by yourself.

WaniKani wants to emulate real life as much as possible, and we don’t want to use “make you feel like you’re learning but you actually aren’t” tactics. Those are gross.
