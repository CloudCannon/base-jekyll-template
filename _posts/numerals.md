For kanji or vocabulary that have numbers in them, you'll need to spell out the number instead of just using the numeral. Why? The answer is two-fold:

For starters, numerals are not vocabulary words, technically speaking.

There's also a technical reason. WaniKani gives you some leeway with your English meaning answers, counting your answer as right even if you're a couple letters off. That's great when you accidentally type "emter" instead of "enter" but not so great if you think ÂçÅ is "20" or "100" instead of "10." Since they're both only one character off, WaniKani can't tell the difference and would give you credit for both.

So for now, numerals will not be allowed, but there's a chance we may change that in the future.
