That depends on you. If you go really, _really_ fast and get pretty much everything right all the time, you can get through all 60 levels in about a year. That's breakneck speed, however.

Getting to level 60 in a year and half is a more reasonable speed that's still fairly quick. You'll need to use WaniKani diligently, but you won't have your timetable sunk if you miss a single day, or have a bad review session. Once you've gotten to level 60, it'll take about six more months to finish burning everything last item.

Ultimately, your speed is going to come down to how quickly you do the items in your lesson queue, how often you do your reviews (once or twice a day is what we recommend), and how many correct/incorrect answers you’re giving. It might feel slow at times but, compared to traditional methods, we bet you’ll notice results to be both easier and much faster.
