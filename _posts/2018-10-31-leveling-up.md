You've started WaniKani, you're doing your [lessons](x) and [reviews](x), but how do you level up?

Do your reviews.

The goal is to get your items to [guru](x) status or higher, which not only [unlocks new lessons](x) for you, but determines when you level up. You need to guru all of the radicals and 90% of the kanji for the current level to get promoted to the next one. There are two progress bars on the WaniKani front page, one for radicals and one for kanji, which show how you're doing.
