If you'd like to change your subscription plan you can always do so in your [subscription settings](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription).

## Monthly to Annual

If you switch from a monthly to an annual subscription, any unused time will be subtracted from the annual price.

## Annual to Monthly

If you switch from an annual to a monthly subscription, any unused time you have will be credited to your account. Each month, we will draw from that until itâ€™s gone. When you've used that up, normal monthly payment charges will start up again.

## Monthly or Annual to Lifetime

If you switch from a monthly or annual subscription to a Lifetime subscription, any unused time will be subtracted from the Lifetime price.
