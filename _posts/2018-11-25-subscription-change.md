Absolutely! If you would like to change your subscription you can do so anytime over in your [subscriptions settings](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription). If you have extra time left, the system will automatically prorate you for unused time and subtract that from your new total.

If you’d like to switch from Yearly to Monthly, the extra time will also be credited to your account and we will draw from that until it’s gone. When you've used that up, normal monthly payment charges will start up again.
