**note:** (For seo purposes, we'll make this one just about how we don't have an iOS app)

Are you using the official WaniKani app?

Probably not, because currently we don't have an official app on the App Store or Google Play Store. Most likely, you're using a third-party app, so please send _them_ a message telling them their app isn't working.

There are a few third-party mobile apps out there that work pretty well, though. You'll need to add your API key, [which can be found in your Account Page](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/account). For suggestions on third-party apps to run WaniKani on your phone, head on over to the community forums. There's an [API and third party apps section](https://community.wanikani.com/c/wanikani/api-and-third-party-apps) filled with helpful posts and people.
