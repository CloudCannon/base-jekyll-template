The first three levels are free. This gets you around one month (if you're using WaniKani every day), ~90 kanji, and ~200 vocabulary words, which should be a big enough sample size to figure out if our system is for you.

To unlock levels 4+ (as well as some other perks), you can upgrade to a premium account in your subscription settings. If you aren’t near the end of level 3 yet, please don’t subscribe! (Unless you’re in the mood to give us extra money, but we’d rather you save it and spend it on yourself. You deserve something nice.)

WaniKani has three subscriptions plans you can choose from:

 + $9/month
 + $89/year USD
 + $299/Lifetime (pay once, get access forever).

 Monthly and Yearly subscriptions are recurring charges, so please be sure to cancel after subscribing if you don’t want to be billed automatically. You'll still be able to use WaniKani for the rest of the time you paid for, but you won't be charged again at the end of it.

 You can cancel your subscription from the [Subscription>Billing](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription/billing) page.
