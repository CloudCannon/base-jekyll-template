Toonstep will send an email to the email address associated with your account when attempting to sign in from a new IP address. To learn more about how ToonStep works, see [What is Toonstep?](/account-settings/toonstep).

If you're having trouble finding the "new location" email, here are some tips:

## Finding the email

Most mail clients provide simple ways to search for specific email in your inbox. Search for emails from "noreply@corporateclash.net", below we have provided instructions for some providers: 

  - **Gmail**: in the search box, enter `in:anywhere from:noreply@corporateclash.net` or click [here](https://clash.lol/gmailactivation)
  - **Outlook**/**Hotmail**: in the search box, enter `from:noreply@corporateclash.net`
  - **Yahoo**: in the search box, enter `from:noreply@corporateclash.net`

You should see an email with the subject line "ToonStep: Location Confirmation". Click on the email, then click on the "verify" button in the email.

After you click verify, you should have visited the webpage with information about the login attempt.


## Knowing if it's you

There are some tips you can use to know whether or not this is you trying to sign in:

  - If you recently initiated a sign-in: emails are almost instant and usually don't take much time to process. If you receive a ToonStep email and you didn't recently try to sign-in, you should [reset your password](/account-help/reset-password).
  - From your ISP:  If the "ISP" section shows the internet provider you use, it is likely you trying to sign in.
