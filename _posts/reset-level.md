So you started WaniKani and, for a while, things were going great. Then something happened; you got busy with school, your started pulling overtime for your job, you adopted twelve rescue pets, and your computer became sentient and tried to take over the world. It's OK, we've all been there.

Whatever it was, you didn't have time for WaniKani like you used to. Now, months later, you're ready to get back on the horse and start learning kanji again. You log back in, only to find an angry horde of reviews ready to burn down your farm and steal your livestock. Even worse, you've forgotten some of the kanji and the mnemonics that went along with them. What are you supposed to do?

Don't worry. For starters, things probably aren't quite as bad as they look at first glance. Let's say you have 800 reviews waiting for you in the queue. That's a lot! But that isn't going to be 800 reviews _every day._ A lot of those items are going to at higher SRS levels, meaning that they won't be showing up every day. If you can fight your way through the first giant review pile, you'll find that the number of reviews that pops back up the next day is much lower, maybe even low enough to be manageable.

If not, then you have the option to reset your WaniKani account back to an earlier level. The reset puts you back at the _start_ of that level, meaning you'll lose all the data at and above where you choose to reset to. Resetting back to level 1 will wipe _everything,_ meaning that you're effectively starting over fresh. The reset doesn't just remove reviews and unlocks, though, it also clears out any custom synonyms or notes had for those levels, so make sure you're OK with losing all that before you take the plunge.

You can reset your account over in the [Danger Zone](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/danger_zone), which is under your account settings.
