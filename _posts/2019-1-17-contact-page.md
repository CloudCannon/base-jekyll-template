There are a few different ways to get in touch with us.

* <a onclick="FrontChat('show')">Chat with Us</a> 
* Email: [hello@wanikani.com](mailto:hello@wanikani.com)
* Twitter: [@wanikaniapp](https://twitter.com/WaniKaniApp)

Or our own special [contact form](https://www.wanikani.com/contact).

If you have a problem, email is the best way to let us know. We don't have people on 24/7, but we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

If you're reporting a typo or a content-related error, make sure to include the item you're talking about and a quick explanation of what's wrong. For example:

If you're reporting a bug, describe what happened and when. Some good information to include would be:

1. What OS and browser were you using? (You can check yours [here](https://supportdetails.com) if you're not sure.)
2. Are you using any third-party scripts or extensions with WaniKani?
3. Did you have more than one tab of WaniKani open at the time? (Oh oh, don't do that.)

Screenshots are always helpful too! The more information you give us about what happened, the better we'll be able to help you.

Finally, if you're contacting us about something to do with your subscription or account, **please** make sure that you're emailing us from the email address associated with your WaniKani account. We need to know that it's really you before we make any changes.
