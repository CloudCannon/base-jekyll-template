WaniKani’s [SRS](#) spans across nine levels, which are split across five groups.

Apprentice → Guru → Master → Enlightened → Burned

Apprentice consists of the first four SRS levels. Guru consists of two levels. Master, Enlightened, and Burned represent single levels.

In order to reach Guru from Apprentice, you must get an item to level 5 on the SRS scale. If you get an item correct, it goes up one level. If you get an item incorrect, it goes down one or more levels, depending on how far along you are, the type of review (radical, kanji, or vocabulary), and how many times you answer the review incorrectly. The lowest level is level 1, so even if you answer something incorrectly a ton, that's as far down the scale as it will go.

## How does it work?

Let’s pretend you are trying to get the kanji 大 to guru, and you've already learned 大 during lessons. Here are your answers:

Correct (+1 level, so it's now at SRS level 2) \\
Correct (+1 level, SRS level 3) \\
Correct (+1 level, SRS level 4) \\
Incorrect once before getting it correct (-2 levels, SRS level 2) \\
Correct (+1 level, SRS level 3) \\
Correct (+1 level, SRS level 4) \\
Correct (+1 level, SRS level 5 **GURU**)

When an item reaches Guru, that means you know that item fairly well, but not great. Enough to unlock available associated items, like kanji that use a radical, or vocabulary that use a kanji, etc.

## What do Guru, Master, Enlightened, and Burned mean?

**Guru:** You know an item fairly well. Any available, associated items will unlock and appear in your Lessons queue.

**Master:** You should be able to recall these items without using the mnemonics, usually.

**Enlightened:** You should be able to recall these items without the mnemonic, fairly quickly. The answer should appear without much effort.

**Burned:** This item is “fluent” in your brain. The answer comes with little-to-no effort. You will remember this item for a long, long time. Even if you don’t use it and “forget” it sometime in the future, it should come back to you quickly after recalling it. Items that are “burned” no longer show up in reviews. You can unburn an item on an item’s individual page, which returns the item to Apprentice.

## What are actual SRS timings?

Our timing intervals are meant to fall _just_ before you'll forget the item.

Once you finish the Lesson for an item it becomes Apprentice 1. There is a 4 hour wait until that item appears in your Reviews. If you get that Review correct, the item moves up to Apprentice 2, and your wait is now 8 hours.

Apprentice 1 → **4 hours** → Apprentice 2 \\
Apprentice 2 → **8 hours** → Apprentice 3 \\
Apprentice 3 → **1 day** → Apprentice 4 \\
Apprentice 4 → **2 days** → Guru 1 \\
Guru 1 → **4 days** → Guru 2 \\
Guru 2 → **2 weeks** → Master \\
Master → **1 month** → Enlightened \\
Enlightened → **4 months** → Burned

Reviews are also floored to the beginning of the hour, so you won't get new reviews every couple minutes. Instead, you'll get (hopefully), a nice manageable chunk.
