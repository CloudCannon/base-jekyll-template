WaniKani has audio clips for the Japanese readings, but only for vocabulary words. Radicals only have English names, so they don't need them (hearing them wonâ€™t help you learn kanji). Kanji are just pieces of the puzzle. They have readings (usually more than), but hearing them on their own without context doesn't mean much. Once the kanji is inside a vocabulary word, however, it's got a definite reading, which we do have audio for. You can hear all of the readings in their proper context with the vocabulary.

If you want to automatically play the audio clips after answering a vocabulary reading review, you can activate that in your [settings](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/app).

If the audio clips for the vocab aren't playing, first check and make sure you're using one of our [supported browsers](https://knowledge.wanikani.com/posts/browser-support.md). If you are, and it's still not working, you can send us an email at [hello@wanikani.com](hello@wanikani.com).
