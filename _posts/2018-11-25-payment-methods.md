Introduction

## What type of payment can I use?

WaniKani accepts most major credit cards. If you don’t have access to a credit card we can manually accept PayPal for one-time yearly and Lifetime memberships. If you’re interested in this method, please send an email us at [hello@wanikani.com](hello@wanikani.com).

## Can I use other currencies?

Yup! If you're from outside the United States, the currency conversion will be handled by your bank or card provider. Be aware that some banks may charge you additional fees for the currency conversion.

## What about pre-paid cards?

Maybe. If you’re planning on using a prepaid/gift card make sure that 1) it has enough money on it, and 2) that you can use it both online and for recurring charges. Some prepaid cards really don’t like being used for these things, and some do. It’s a toss up whether they’ll work.

## Can I use Apple Pay/Venmo/bank transfer/Western Union/etc.?

Nope, 'fraid not. We don't accept any other payment methods except for the two above.
