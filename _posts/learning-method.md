You may be wondering how WaniKani can teach you so much, so fast. There are many factors, but here are the main ones:

1. You learn kanji and vocabulary meanings and readings with mnemonics. This means you are able to memorize more items in one sitting, plus the ability to recall them degrades more slowly over time.
2. WaniKani teaches you efficiently by using a [Spaced Repetition System](x) to manage your reviews.
3. WaniKani makes you learn things the "hard" way, which means no [furigana](x), no [multiple choice](x), or anything else that gives your brain a shortcut.
4. The ordering of items in WaniKani was created specifically for adults who speak English, not for kids that already speak Japanese. Hereâ€™s the difference: Japanese schoolchildren learn kanji in an order based on how simple the meaning of a kanji is. So a kanji that has fifteen strokes but has a simple meaning will come before a kanji that has two strokes but has a difficult meaning. As an English speaking adult (or close to it), you already understand the meanings of difficult words and concepts, but the difference between a kanji with twenty strokes and two strokes is huge for you! WaniKani teaches you simple kanji (in terms of structure) first and builds off that knowledge to grow your ability to learn more complicated kanji. In the long term, you are able to learn all the kanji you need to be literate much more quickly and with less friction.
5. WaniKani only teaches the most important things, and ignores the rest. Most kanji have a meaning or reading that's used 90% of the time, and a bunch of other readings that make up the remaining 10%. While that 10% is still important, we don't want you spending a bunch of time and effort on these that you could be using to learn new kanji. That means we also skip things like handwriting and [stroke order](x). By keeping you focused on the most useful stuff, we get you reading real Japanese sooner, where you'll learn all those exceptions anyway.
