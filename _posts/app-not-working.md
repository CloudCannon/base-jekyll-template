### The WaniKani App isn't working!

Are you using the official WaniKani app?

Don't worry, that's a trick question. The official WK app isn't out yet so, if you're using it, you're either on the WaniKani team, or you've snuck into our office and are living behind the couch next to the office plants.

For everyone else, there are a few third-party mobile apps out there that use WaniKani's API key to sync up with your regular account. Unfortunately, since we didn't make them, we can't offer much support when they stop working. Your best bet is head over to the [forums](https://community.wanikani.com/c/wanikani/api-and-third-party-apps) and ask around there - there's a good chance someone's had the same issue before and knows how to fix it.
