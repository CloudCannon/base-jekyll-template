There are three types of subscription plans available for your convenience (or annoyance). They can be found in your [subscription settings](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription).

## Monthly Subscription

A monthly subscription is $9/month and is a recurring charge. That means it will automatically charge your card each month. It renews itself [unless it's canceled](#) (by you!).

## Annual Subscription

An annual subscription is $89/month and is a recurring charge. That's like getting two months free compared to paying for a monthly subscription for an entire year!

This plan automatically charges your card each year and renews itself ([unless it's canceled](#)).

## Lifetime Account

This isn't actually a subscription, but a lifelong promise that you'll be learning kanji with us until we're all dead and gone.

A Lifetime account is a one-time payment of $299.

That's it! Then you have access to the site for as long as we're alive. (Forever, crabigator willing.)
