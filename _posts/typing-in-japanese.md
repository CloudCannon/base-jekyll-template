### Typing in Japanese/Using the IME

You've Guru'ed those first radicals and finally gotten some real kanji. That's great! But now WaniKani wants you to type stuff in Japanese. So how do you turn what you type in your non-Japanese keyboard into kana? Don't worry, it's actually pretty easy.

For starters, WaniKani has a built in [IME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method) that will handle all the conversions, so you don't need to install a Japanese keyboard on your computer or device. Any time you need to answer in Japanese, WaniKani will automatically change what you type into kana.

(If you _want_ to install one for other purposes, check out our [walkthrough](http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-install-japanese-keyboard/) over on Tofugu.)

Of course, you still need to know what to type, but we've got you covered there too. Check out our [guide to typing in Japanese](http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-type-in-japanese/) any time you're not sure how to get a particular character. WaniKani also has a dropdown menu of all the hiragana characters that you can select from. It's no replacement for learning how to type, but it's great for when you know the answer but just can't remember how to type that one dakuten.
