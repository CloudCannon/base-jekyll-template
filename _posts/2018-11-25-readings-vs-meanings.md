You've gotten through the first batch of radicals and unlocked your first kanji. Congratulations! Kanji and vocabulary work a bit differently than radicals, however. For starters, they have two parts to them: Readings and Meanings.

The _Reading_ of a kanji (or a vocab term) is the Japanese pronunciation(s) of the character. The _Meaning,_ on the other hand, is exactly what it sounds like: the English definition of the kanji. Not surprisingly, the answers for Readings are going to be written in kana. Meanings will be written in romaji, a.k.a. in English.

There are a couple ways to tell which answer you should enter during reviews. First of all, there is a label that says either "Meaning" or "Reading." The background of this area will be dark if it's asking for a Reading, and light-gray if asking for a meaning.

Another hint to help you out: If it's asking for a reading, it will automatically change your text to kana. So if you're trying to type in the answer "to enter" and it looks like "とえんてｒ," you'll realize you're putting in the wrong answer. The opposite is true as well.

Of course, you'll still need to know _what_ to type, so make sure you're brushed up on how to [type in Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-type-in-japanese/).
