"I just noticed that some of your radical names are wrong!"

Hold up a second, little durtle. Before you fire off that blistering email telling us everything we've gotten wrong, let's quickly talk about what radicals _are._

Radicals are primarily a tool to classify and index kanji. You can also use them to help figure out what a kanji means - WaniKani does this by incorporating the radicals into mnemonics - but mostly radicals are there so you have a way to look kanji up in the dictionary.

The most commonly used set of radicals is probably the 214 Kangxi radicals, which get their name from an [18th Century Chinese dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Dictionary). This might be the most commonly used list of radicals, but it's not the only one.

When putting WaniKani together, we found that the Kangxi names - which, remember, exist to help you _look up_ kanji - weren't always the best choice for learning what kanji actually _mean._ When that happened, we changed the names to create better mnemonics - to the great frustration of nitpickers everywhere.
