Our discord server is constantly monitored by moderators, however sometimes messages and voice call conversations can go un-noticed. 

To report any activity that goes against our server's rules, send your report to the "Clash modmail" bot at the top of the server list, or, for less urgent matters, [contact support](/general/contact-support/).

Please include relevant screenshots, user names and any other information that would help us identify and properly address the situation.
