Many kanji have multiple readings and sometimes we'll teach you more than one at once.

When you get to the Lesson Quiz and Reviews, you need to choose **one** of these readings to enter. We do not accept two readings at once.

For example:

大 should be たい **or** だい \\
**Not** たいだい \\
**Not** たい、だい

力 should be りき **or** りょく \\
**Not** りきりょく \\
**Not** りき、りょく

Some items have a lot of possible answers, and we don’t want people to spend thirty seconds typing them all out.

And remember: you'll reinforce these different readings with the vocabulary, so there's no need to force you to remember both every single time you see the kanji.
