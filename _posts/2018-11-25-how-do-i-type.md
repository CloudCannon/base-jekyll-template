Need a shortcut for some of those miscellaneous typing issues?

## How do I type the “ー” in ビー玉?

ー is the dash or minus symbol on your keyboard. It will automatically convert to the Japanese version during your Lessons and Reviews.

## How do I type in katakana?

You don’t need to type in katakana!

For words like アメリカ人 just go with あめりかじん and we’ll mark it right. But if you _really_ want to type in katakana, just hit the shift or caps-lock key before you start typing.
## How do I type the small tsu?

To get the small tsu, you don't have to type ltu or xtsu or any of those other combinations. Think about what っ means in Japanese. It's there to mark a geminate consonant. And you spell that in romaji with two of that consonant in a row. So type the Japanese word in romaji using a double consonant. Your Japanese keyboard will know what to do and generate a っ in the proper place. 

Here are some of examples of how to type the small tsu in some of the early level vocabulary you'll encounter:  
みっつ = mittsu  
やっつ = yattsu  
よっつ = yottsu
