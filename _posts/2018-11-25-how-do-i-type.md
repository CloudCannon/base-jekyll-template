Need a shortcut for some of those miscellaneous typing issues?

## How do I type the “ー” in ビー玉?

ー is the dash or minus symbol on your keyboard. It will automatically convert to the Japanese version during your Lessons and Reviews.

## How do I type in katakana?

You don’t need to type in katakana!

For words like アメリカ人 just go with あめりかじん and we’ll mark it right. But if you _really_ want to type in katakana, just hit the shift or caps-lock key before you start typing.
