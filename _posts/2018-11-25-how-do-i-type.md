## How do I type the “ー” in ビー玉 (or anything else)?
Just use the dash or minus symbol on your keyboard - it will automatically get converted into the long version.

## How do I type in katakana?
Actually, you don’t need to type in katakana, you can always type the readings in hiragana for your answers. For words like アメリカ人 just go with あめりかじん and we’ll mark it right. But if you really want to type in katakana just hit the shift or caps-lock key before you start typing.
