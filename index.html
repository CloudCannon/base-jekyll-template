	<h2 class="editable main-title">About Wood River Ballroom</h2>
	<p class="editable">I am passionate about dance.  I have been dancing for over 15 years studying Ballroom, swing, and contemporary dance.  Although I love all forms of dance, what I like to share and teach is the joy of partner and social dancing.  Between the structured movement of ballroom, the carefree style of swing, and the free expression of contemporary dance my teaching style is very pliable to meet the needs of those I teach. <br> <br>I believe anyone can learn to dance.</p>
